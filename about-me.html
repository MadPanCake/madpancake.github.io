									<p>My name is Szymon Witkowski. I'm a 20 years old, video game passionate. I always
									loved playing video games, but when I was 8, an idea has come to my mind. What if I
									could create my own game?
									Since then, I then tried Scratch and other simple game creators.</p>
									<p>A few years later, we discovered Minecraft with friends. Since this day, we're
									playing it all the time. When we were at school, we kept discussing what are we gonna
									do in-game once we come back home. At some point we discovered servers. At this time
									everything changed. We could play our beloved game together and with other players.
									We've always loved factions and many more classic game modes. Finally, I've got an idea,
									to create my own server. I did it, and we have always played it together. At the beginning
									it was just survival, with some plugins. At some point, basic survival with plugins was not
									enough for me anymore. When I was 12, I started creating my own mini-games and game modes.
									In junior high school, my friends started to focus
									on school more, but I've always believed video games are my future. I've dreamed about
									creating a server so good and so big that will allow me to do it for a living.
									</p>
									<p>Years have passed and I've always had this hobby, of making some unique mini-games that
									we can play with friends. I always loved creating and enjoying them play. At some point I was
									so crazy on it, I was noting things to improve while we were playing and I immediately got
									to work on it when we finished!
									I've always treated it as a hobby, I loved doing it. My servers kept improving and at some point
									my friends said something along the lines of 'hey, it looks as good as hypixel!' and then I realized
									that he's not wrong. My servers have seriously got very good. Their quality started to come closer
									and closer to the biggest networks, even though they were made just to impress my friends.</p>
									<p>One day, I've decided. I love it. I'm good at it. I want to make it my job.
									That's when I've started to announce myself on Discord and that's why you're reading this page.
									I hope you found my story interesting and that I didn't bore you too much.
									Now, there is nothing else for me to do, but encourage you to check out the rest of the website,
									watch the videos and decide for yourself, if you want to use my services.</p>
