									It has all started as a little game we created with friends, while playing on a Plots server. The idea was to give everyone 30 minutes(although it was always extended infinitely!) so they can build
									their own castles, and after the time ends, we turn off creative and fight each other, with the ultimate goal of stealing each others flags.
									We loved playing it. But unfortunately, one day, after we finished our castles and were about to fight, we discovered that staff has disabled the PvP. Turns out it wasn't really intentional
									for the players to be able to fight on their plots. We were devastated. But then I thought to myself... What if I have remade our favorite 'Islands' minigame on to my own server?
									</p>
									<p>
									That turned out to be an amazing idea. In a new format, there were pre-made islands in the sky (like on Sky Wars), instead of plots. We no longer had to use creative mode to build our castles,
									because I've added mini-islands in-between our player islands, filled with ores and loot chests. We were playing Islands every weekend, matches lasted for up to 2 hours at times, even though it was just
									us 3 playing! I loved Islands a lot and always tried to improve it. I would always note things I thought could be improved, even in the middle of gameplay (my friends hated me for it!)
									A few years have passed and I have decided, that since I have much better knowledge and skills, I wanted to remake Islands from scratch, to make it even better.
									However, I had trouble with keeping my motivation up, and I haven't managed to do it for a long time. <br />
									</p>

									<p>
									Time has passed, and I have realized I had more and more friends that I could play my servers with. One day I have finally made a decision. I'm gonna make 'Sky Islands 2.0'.
									I wanted it epic. I wanted it huge. I wanted it as well-developed as it could. I even got my friend to help me with building, we started out with a large map skeleton, that we later
									populated with all sorts of structures, trees, etc. <br />
									A few weeks later, it was done... 'Sky Islands 2.0', waiting for new players to come and test it out. In new format, it could be played not only by 3 players, but by up to 12 players and more!
									Once we finally played, we had such a blast. It was super worth it! It's one of the game modes that make me proud to this day.
									</p>
									<p>
									The all new Sky Islands 2.0 featured a huge map, with 2 large team islands, with a lot of space to build team's castles. Forest islands on each side of the map, containing underground
									catacombs filled with valuable chests and ores. And middle islands, having very important - Siege Workshops, contraptions that let you create Automatic Turrets, which are your first pillar
									of base defence. And in the center of the map - Boss island. That's where you can drop a Siege Crossbow - legendary weapon which provides advantage at long-distance combat.
